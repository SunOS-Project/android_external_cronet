# Don't preload the classes that we would normally exclude from Cronet jars, as
# they are guaranteed to be dead code. This list is copy-pasted from Chromium:
# see _jar_excluded_patterns in //components/cronet/android/BUILD.gn.
#
# This is not just an optimization - some of the classes will fail to preload,
# for example `org.chromium.base.library_loader.LibraryLoader` cannot be
# preloaded because it depends on `org.chromium.build.NativeLibraries` which is
# stripped from the build.
#
# TODO: if these classes are dead code, we should not be shipping them in the
# first place. See also b/380356540. Also, this list is painful to maintain.
